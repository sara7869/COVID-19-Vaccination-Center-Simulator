# COVID-19 Vaccination Center Program

## Overview
The COVID-19 Vaccination Center program is designed to manage vaccinations for patients efficiently. It allows a maximum of six patients to be vaccinated at a time and provides various functionalities for operators to manage the vaccination process.

## Features
- **View Vaccination Booths:** Display all booths and their statuses.
- **Add/Remove Patients:** Add patients to booths or remove them when done.
- **Stock Management:** Keep track of vaccination stock (initially set to 150), with alerts when stock reaches 20.
- **Patient Sorting:** View patients sorted alphabetically without using library sort routines.
- **File Operations:** Store and load program data to/from files.
- **Waiting List:** Manage patients waiting for vaccination if all booths are occupied.
- **JavaFX GUI:** An interactive graphical interface for entering patient details and generating receipts.

## Tasks Breakdown

4. **Linked List Version:** Implement a waiting list using linked lists for patients when booths are full.
5. **JavaFX Interface:** Develop a GUI for operators to enter patient details and generate receipts.
6. **Testing & Report:** Create test cases to validate program functionality and provide documentation.
